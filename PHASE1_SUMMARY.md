# MailBot Phase 1: Dual-Mode Pill & Summarize UI Shell

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Dual-Mode Pill** (`injectDualModePill()`)
- Replaced single "MailBot" button with segmented control: **[Compose] [Summarize]**
- Dark theme with white text (consistent with existing design)
- Compose mode active by default
- Both buttons toggle between modes

#### 2. **Mode Switching Functions**
- `openComposeMode()`: Opens existing compose panel (unchanged behavior)
- `openSummarizeMode()`: Shows new summarize panel

#### 3. **Summarize Panel Shell** (`createSummarizePanel()`)
Complete UI structure with:
- **Header**: "Thread Summary" + close button
- **Level Selector**: Short / Average / Detailed (toggleable)
- **View Toggle**: Summary / Action Items (switches content)
- **Editable Body**: `.mb-summary-body` with placeholder text
- **Action Buttons**: Generate, Copy, Insert
- **Metadata Line**: "Generated · X messages · Last updated: —"

#### 4. **Styling** (`styleSummarizePanel()`)
- Dark minimalist theme (#000 background, white text)
- Consistent with existing MailBot design
- Responsive button states
- Fixed positioning (same as compose panel)

#### 5. **Event Handlers** (`attachSummarizePanelListeners()`)
- **Level selector**: Changes summary depth (placeholder)
- **Toggle**: Switches between Summary and Action Items views
- **Generate**: Placeholder response (Phase 1 - no AI)
- **Copy**: Copies content to clipboard
- **Insert**: Inserts summary into compose field
- **Close**: Hides summarize panel

### What Works

✅ Dual pill appears in compose and thread views  
✅ Compose mode unchanged (full backward compatibility)  
✅ Summarize panel shows complete UI shell  
✅ Summary/Action Items toggle switches view visually  
✅ Level selector (Short/Average/Detailed) works  
✅ Copy and Insert buttons functional  
✅ Generate is placeholder only (logs to console)  
✅ No new permissions required  
✅ No network requests  
✅ Accessible and styled consistently  

### What's NOT Implemented (By Design)

❌ AI summarization logic (Phase 2)  
❌ Thread message extraction for summarization (Phase 2)  
❌ Action items extraction (Phase 2)  
❌ Message count detection (Phase 2)  
❌ Gemini Nano integration for summaries (Phase 2)  

### Files Modified

- `content/content.js` - Added ~450 lines of new code:
  - `injectDualModePill()`
  - `openComposeMode()`
  - `openSummarizeMode()`
  - `createSummarizePanel()`
  - `styleSummarizePanel()`
  - `attachSummarizePanelListeners()`
  - Modified `attachMailBotButton()` to use dual pill
  - Updated `expandPanel()` to default to Compose mode

### No Changes Required

- `manifest.json` - No new permissions
- No new external dependencies
- No CSS files (inline styles only)

### Testing Checklist
